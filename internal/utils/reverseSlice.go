func ReverseSlice[T any](arr []T) {
	for i, j := 0, len(arr)-1; i < j; i, j = i+1, j-1 {

// Since slices in Go are references to underlying arrays, any modification to the slice elements inside the function will reflect in the original slice. Thereâ€™s no need to pass a pointer to the slice or return it.
